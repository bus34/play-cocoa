# Play Cocoa!

This project houses both the OS X desktop menu item Play client as well as the the iOS Play Client.


## Play Item

Play Item is a streaming client for Play that runs on Mac OS X 10.7 and up. It simply lives in your menu bar allowing you to start and stop the stream. It also shows the current track playing and what is currently queued.
